<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This extension procedure provides permutation tests for simple two-group t tests, anova, and regression.  These tests do not rely on a normality assumption, and they are appropriate even for small datasets where asymptotic properties might not be reliable.
<p>
This procedure does not support case weights or split files.   They will be ignored with a warning.
Cases with missing data will be excluded listwise.
Variable measurement levels are used to provide appropriate handling for categorical and continuous (scale) variables, so be sure that these are set correctly.  The dialog box
generates syntax for the STATS PERM extension command.
</p>

<h2>Main Dialog</h2>
<p><b>Dependent Variable:</b>Select a scale level dependent variable.

<p><b>Independent and Group Variables</b> and <b>Interaction Variables:</b>
<p>For a two group t test or anova model, specify the group variable (simple t test) or variables (anova and regression).  Variables with a categorical measurement level will be converted to dummy variables.  Variables in the <b>Independent Variables</b> box will be additive, and variables in the
<b>Interactions</b> box will be multiplicative with all combinations included up to 
the default or specified maximum degree.  For example,
if there are three interaction variables, x, y, and z and allways is chosen for the degree, 
the model will include x, y, z, x*y, x*z, y*z, and x*y*z.  Since main effects for interaction variables
are automatically included, you do not need to also list those variables in the Independent Variables box.
<p><b>Maximum Interaction Order</b> specifies the highest interaction degree to include.
By default, that is determined by the number of variables in the Interactions box, but you
can limit it. In the previous example, specifying all two-way would include x, y, z, x*y, x*z, and y*z but
not x*y*z.
<p>In the dialog box, only one interaction group can be specified, but in syntax you can have
up to three groups.  Both categorical and scale variables can be used.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p><b>Number of Permutations:</b> Specify the number of permutations to be used.
<p><b>Permutation Method:</b>
<p>When there are multiple independent variables involved, such as typical for anova and regression, for
each test, one variable is selected at a time, and all the others are considered nuisance variables, Permutation tests assume exchangeability under the null hypothesis, but the nuisance variables
violate this assumption, so the data are transformed in order to reduce the effect of the nuisance variables
before performing the tests.  The output shows all the estimated coefficients each computed with
the effect of the other variables removed.<p>
<p>The first reference below explains the seven methods available. Here is an extract from that
documentation.  y is the dependent variable, D is the matrix of nuisance variables, and X is the variable
of interest.
<p>
The <b>freedman_lane</b> method  works as follows: we
first fit the “small” model which only uses the nuisance variables D as predictors. Then, we
permute its residuals and add them to the fitted values. Theses steps produce the permuted
response variable which constitutes the “new sample”. It is fitted using the unchanged
design D and X. In this procedure, only the residuals are permuted and they are supposed
to share the same expectation (of zero) under the null hypothesis. For each permutation,
the effect of nuisance variables is hence reduced.
<p>
The <b>manly</b> method simply permutes the
response (this method is sometimes called raw permutations). Even if this method does not
take into account the nuisance variables, it still has good asymptotic properties when using
studentized statistics. 
<p><b>draper_stoneman</b> permutes the design of interest (note that without
nuisance variables permuting the design is equivalent to permuting the response variable).
However, this method ignores the correlation between D and X that is typically present in
regressions or unbalanced designs.

<p>For the <b>dekker</b> method, we first orthogonalize X with
respect to D, then we permute the design of interest. This transformation reduces the influence
of the correlation between D and X and is more appropriate for unbalanced design. 
<p>
The
<b>kennedy</b> method orthogonalizes all of the elements (y, D and X) with respect to the nuisance
variables, removing the nuisance variables in the equation, and then permutes the obtained
response. Doing so, all the design matrices lie in the span of X, a sub-space of observed
design X and D. However this projection modifies the distribution of the residuals that lose
exchangeability (for original IID data). 
<p>
The <b>huh_jhun</b> method is similar to
kennedy but it applies a second transformation (V ⊤
D ) to the data to ensure exchangeability (up
to the second moment, V ⊤
D RDy ∼ (0, In−(p−q)σ2)). It implies that the projctions matrices for the huh_jhun
method have smaller dimensions. 
<p>
The <b>terBraak</b> method is similar to freedman_lane but
uses the residuals of the full model. This permutation method creates a new response variable
y∗ which assumes that the observed value of the estimate ˆ β|y is the true value of β.
Computing the statistic using y∗, X, D would not produce a permutation distribution under
the null hypothesis. To circumvent this issue, the method changes the null hypothesis when
computing the statistics at each permutation to H0 : β = ˆ β|y = (X⊤RDX)−1X⊤RDy|y. The
right part of this new hypothesis corresponds to the observed estimate of the parameters of
interest under the full model, and implicitly uses a pivotal assumption. Note that terBraak
is the only method where the statistic computed with the identity permutation is different
from the observed statistic. The notation RD,X means that the residuals matrix is based on
the concatenation of the matrices D and X.
<p><b>Plot Coefficients</b> Check this box to plot the coefficient distributions.  If there are
many variables, it may be necessary to stretch out the plot in the SPSS Viewer window.</p>
